# AI-Persona Audio Generator

## Overview
The AI-Persona Audio Generator is a project aimed at revolutionizing the way we interact with readings. This project allows for the generation of audio that mimics the voice of a specific individual, based on training with audio recordings. Our goal is to first establish an accurate voice generator, before extending its functionality to reading PDFs. Finally, we aim to implement this on a website and, if time allows, an iOS mobile application.

## Proposed Features
- **Voice Cloning Engine**: Implement a deep learning model capable of analyzing and replicating a person's voice with a small sample size.
- **PDF Reading Capability**: Integrate the voice cloning engine to convert text from PDFs into spoken audio, maintaining the original speaker's voice characteristics.
- **Web Platform**: Develop a user-friendly website that allows users to upload voice samples and PDFs, and receive audio outputs.
- **iOS Application**: If project scope and time permit, create an iOS app to provide mobile access to our services.

## Stakeholders and Intended Users
The intended users of the AI-Persona Audio Generator are individuals who seek a personalized auditory experience, such as listening to books or documents in a familiar voice. Pre-requisites for users include the ability to provide clear voice recordings for the initial training phase.

Stakeholders for this project include the me, potential investors, and the end-users who stand to benefit from a more personalized audio experience.
